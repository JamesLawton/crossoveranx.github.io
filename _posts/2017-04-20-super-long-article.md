title: "How to get into University in Germany - First Hand Experience"
categories: misc

Free. Tuition. These are the two words that have droves of eager students coming from all over the world to Germany. What's not to like? Germany boasts a first class education recognizable all over the world, an experience abroad like no other (see - castles), and a healthcare system that makes me *want* to get sick. Dreaming about this experience and actually attending though, are entirely different things. I know that I was thoroughly unprepared for the adventure - even after reading countless articles and guides that I thought would ensure my initial success. My goal is to provide an account for others that are looking into Germany as an option for university from somebody who has experienced it first hand.

A little bit about me: I'm originally from the good ole' US of A and while some of my experiences will be more applicable towards students from my home country, I will be sure to point out potential differences. I'm originally from Pennsylvania and I ended up moving out of state for my undergraduate degree to Florida, which meant racking up those wonderful out-of-state tuition costs. Afterwards, I worked for a couple years and realized that my field wasn't making me happy so I wanted to pursue another degree. One problem, though. I was(am) still paying off my student loans, so how could I afford another degree? Through my research, I found out about the possibility of studying in Germany. Now, I am currently in a masters program at the Technical University of Munich. 

Many of the other guides I found about this process really didn't help once I was actually *here*. For all the talk of visa preparation, health insurance, etc., I felt woefully unprepared for the reality of living in a foreign nation where I didn't speak the language. I want to give you the real world experience, without the bells and whistles.

# Guide

So, as a prospective German student - what do you want to study? Let me save you quite a bit of research, unless you know German at a [C1 Level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_European_Framework_of_Reference_for_Languages#Common_reference_levels), you won't be attending your undergraduate degree in Germany. You do have the option of studying abroad for a semester with various institutions like [Erasmus](https://esn.org), if this seems like a goal for you in the future, but I hate to say it - almost no undergraduate degrees exist entirely in English.

With that first hurdle finished, let's assume you would like a graduate degree. Great! [This](http://www.mastersportal.eu/countries/11/germany.html) is an excellent site to see if the program you are interested in exists in Germany. I personally went through the rankings of the top universities in Germany to find programs I was interested in, and I suggest you do the same. A word of caution, if your area of interest is not in a STEM(science, technology, engineering, and math) field, it is highly unlikely that it is taught fully in English. In fact, I've never seen it while looking through 50+ university's programs.

Hopefully, I haven't discouraged you yet, as I would like to talk briefly about the application process. You may have heard about the efficiency of Germans, the engineering prowess, and their astute detail-oriented observations. Do you know what else they're good at? Bureaucracy. Germans are very particular about their forms and applications, so I implore you that you make sure that everything is perfect before you send it in. Your i's are dotted, t's are crossed, because you'll run into a situation like mine where I had to overnight my resume because I put my work end date as 'Present' instead of the current month. I highly recommend getting in touch with the admissions department at your particular university if you have any questions to ensure a smooth reception of your documentation. It's typical that you can't e-mail or attach your documents as Germany has very strict data privacy laws which forbid these processes, so keep this in mind when applying.

You've found a program, applied, perhaps had an interview, and got your admissions letter. Congratulations! So, how do you prepare to move your entire life to a foreign country? Many universities will give some tips about finding accommodation, making friends, health insurance, and getting situated. They are worth checking out, but don't put too much emphasis on them as it was not that helpful in my experience. Here's the crucial things to know before you move and what worked for me when I had issues.

## Before you Go

###Health Insurance 
German universities require a confirmation that you are insured in Germany in order to be officially enrolled. Many private health insurance companies, but I would strongly NOT recommend these as they are very specific in what they cover. The two main health insurances that I would recommend are [AOK](https://www.aok.de/) and [TK](https://www.tk.de/), which are both relatively affordable. E-mail a representative at those companies and explain when you are arriving and when you need the insurance to start - they are very familiar with this process and will help expedite your request rather than signing up online without an initial e-mail.

###Visa Process 
Here's where other nationalities experience will differ significantly.  Many websites recommend to apply for a visa in your home country, no exceptions. If you are from one of [these](http://www.germany-visa.org/do-i-need-a-visa/) countries, apply for a visa as soon as you get your acceptance letter. I've had classmates that missed the first month of school due to visa issues. I found from my personal experience and speaking with others, that you can simply apply for the visa in Germany. You have a 90 day grace period in order to obtain your residency and visa, and this was certainly feasible during this time.

###Bank Account (Abroad and Domestic)
Ever heard of Oktoberfest? You would not believe how fast the jubilance of a day spent dancing on tables can come crashing down as an ATM takes your only credit card. Before you leave for Deustchland, contact your domestic bank to ensure that they know you are moving abroad and ask about any offers for international cards - this will make your transition significantly easier.

Furthermore, do some research on competent banks in the city you are moving to, along with contacting a representative of your desired bank. To open a bank account in Germany, you need a plethora of documentation - many of which has to be acquired in a specific order. Inform them of your needs, ask about any student accounts, and also schedule an appointment to ensure that you can get an account on your first visit. When you first arrive in DE, you will be bombarded with a whirlwind of tasks and having a bank account with a debit card will go a long way to reduce your stress.
